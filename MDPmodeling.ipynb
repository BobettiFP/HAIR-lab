Maintaining proper soil moisture is essential for the healthy growth of the apple trees. If the soil is too dry, the trees risk drying out, and if it’s too wet, the roots may rot, damaging the trees. Each morning, Mr. Kim must carefully decide how much water to give, as this decision will affect the soil condition the next day. In addition to water supply, external factors like weather can impact soil moisture, which might cause the moisture levels to fluctuate unexpectedly. Therefore, making the right decision every day is crucial.\n",

Mr. Kim이 나무에 적당한 물을 주면 수분이 5% 증가할 확률이 80%이며, 날씨가 안정적이거나 더 습하면 변화가 없을 확률이 20%입니다. 많은 양의 물을 주면 수분이 20% 증가할 확률이 85%이지만, 외부 요인으로 인해 15% 확률로 25%까지 상승할 수 있습니다. 수분이 적절한 범위 내에 있으면 Mr. Kim은 100,000 KRW의 보상을 받게 됩니다.\n",

Maintaining proper soil moisture is essential for the healthy growth of the apple trees. If the soil is too dry, the trees risk drying out, and if it’s too wet, the roots may rot, damaging the trees. Each morning, Mr. Kim must carefully decide how much water to give, as this decision will affect the soil condition the next day. In addition to water supply, external factors like weather can impact soil moisture, which might cause the moisture levels to fluctuate unexpectedly. Therefore, making the right decision every day is crucial.\n",

Maintaining proper soil moisture is essential for the healthy growth of the apple trees. If the soil is too dry, the trees risk drying out, and if it’s too wet, the roots may rot, damaging the trees. Each morning, Mr. Kim must carefully decide how much water to give, as this decision will affect the soil condition the next day. In addition to water supply, external factors like weather can impact soil moisture, which might cause the moisture levels to fluctuate unexpectedly. Therefore, making the right decision every day is crucial.\n",

Mr. Kim이 나무에 적당한 물을 주면 수분이 5% 증가할 확률이 80%이며, 날씨가 안정적이거나 더 습하면 변화가 없을 확률이 20%입니다. 많은 양의 물을 주면 수분이 20% 증가할 확률이 85%이지만, 외부 요인으로 인해 15% 확률로 25%까지 상승할 수 있습니다. 수분이 적절한 범위 내에 있으면 Mr. Kim은 100,000 KRW의 보상을 받게 됩니다.\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "3. **Rewards**: The rewards are structured such that maintaining moisture within an ideal range yields a positive reward, whereas violating this range incurs a significant penalty.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **MDP value iteration**: We perform value iteration over the defined number of days to compute the maximum expected reward starting from the initial state of 50% moisture.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Policy extraction**: Once we obtain the optimal value function, we extract the best actions for each day by evaluating the actions that lead to the highest expected value.\n",

            "\n",
            "3. **Transition Probabilities**:\n",
            "   - For each action, probabilities of moving from one state to another can be defined based on the problem statement.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Rewards**:\n",
            "   - If Mr. Kim maintains a moisture level within the range on that day, he receives +100,000 KRW.\n",
            "   - If he goes outside the range, he loses -100,000 KRW.\n",
